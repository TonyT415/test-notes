# Notable Members
>[!info] Notable members that are immediately relevant to any players

## **Primarium: Quintus Vitruvius**
The current leader of the Legion, a lion-like [Catfolk](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=17). He isn't one to mince words or dance around turns of phrase. Brutally efficient in both his use of language and on the field of war.

## **Captain: Arnold Schwarz Olympia**
The direct leader of [[Gill Astartes]]. A kind man, instilling in those under his command to respect and care for innocents. Often times favoring careful action, is also just as willing to wade into tides of enemies if it means saving just one more person.

## **Private: Caius Aurius**
A member of Captain Olympia's squad, he has known [[Gill Astartes]] for most of their time as Legionnaires. A hothead, more likely to leap before he looks. This isn't to say he is foolish, it more so says that he is ruled mostly be his emotions, something he has to be lectured on a lot by most of his squadmates.
