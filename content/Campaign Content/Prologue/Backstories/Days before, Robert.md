[[Robert Finley]] had been studying deep magic, ancient techniques of manifesting magic, where he happened to stumble on or in this case manifest his deep curiosity in the form of an Eidolon.

The Eidolon itself is somewhat of a mystery to even Robert. For the time being there seems to be no problems between the two, but every now and then on deep reflection, you seem to sense other thoughts very much not your own.

Your studies seem to try to direct you toward the [[Scattered Isles]].
