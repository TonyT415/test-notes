In place of traditional gods aspects are exactly what they are, aspects. The raw representation of a concept or phenomena.

What made this special from gods, is the ability for these aspects to change people.

Almost like a title or any other role becoming an aspect is exceedingly rare. In addition, Aspects aren't known quantities, nor are they easily identifiable.

## Types of Aspects

### Minor Aspects
Some times referred to as blessings or being blessed. Temporary and not as concentrated in strength. Many times these are really big one time boons.

### Half Aspects
These people are generally more favored to consistently gain multiple opportunities to be granted minor aspects or have a more amplified blessing. The closest near comparison to demigods. Or typical heroes of folklore and myths.

### True Aspects
Actually the best thing to a manifestation of a "god".

>Think Kratos from the god of war games. Probably the cutscene or QuickTime versions where he can just do really insane shit
